DisplayProperties
=================

A small utility to show various properties of a computer display.

## Features

The utility calculates pixel density (pixels per inch) and screen dimensions (in inches) based on the screen's horizontal and vertical resolution, and the diagonal size of the screen (in inches).

## Building

The Display Properties utility depends on QT, and compiles with qmake. In a Linux terminal, simply enter the source directory, run qmake, and run make to get the executable file.
